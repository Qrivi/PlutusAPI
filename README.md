# Goodbye, Plutus. ðŸ‘‹

Plutus started during my final year in college, when my good friend [Jan Pecquet](https://github.com/pekket) and I teamed up to work on a prototype for an Android app that would allow us and fellow students at UCLL to check up on expenses made with our student card. It started as a school assignment, but we decided to continue development and started working on a full and beautiful app that in the long run could replace the student card entirely: we had plans to allow payments over NFC, use NFC for identification to grant access to class rooms and open parking barrels, start on an iOS equivalent, ... 

We made fantastic progress, thanks to our great friend and at least equally great developer [David Op de Beeck](https://github.com/DavidOpDeBeeck) who joined us. However, since all three of us graduated, had to turn in our student cards and lost access to most of UCLL's IT infrastructure, are full time professional developers nowadays, ... it became challenging to find the time to work on Plutus. Commits stopped and the project was no longer maintained, while technology keeps advancing. And that's why I decided to archive this project. We had a good run, we've learnt a lot, and we're still great friends. 

Thank you, Plutus, and thanks Jan and David for your contributions!

# PlutusAPI

This repository will host the source of Plutus' API, in the near future. As soon as the raw core's programmed, we'll be starting this beauty. 

While the core is still in development, the first lines of the API wil most likely be written alongside, in the same project, so head over to [PlutusCore](https://github.com/plutus-dev/PlutusCore) to see what's up on the programming end, or check out [the wiki](https://github.com/plutus-dev/PlutusAPI/wiki) for more information about the upcoming API.
