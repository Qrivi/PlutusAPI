# PlutusAPI

This repository will host the source of Plutus' API, in the near future. As soon as the raw core's programmed, we'll be starting this beauty. 

While the core is still in development, the first lines of the API wil most likely be written alongside, in the same project, so head over to [PlutusCore](https://github.com/plutus-dev/PlutusCore) to see what's up on the programming end, or check out [the wiki](https://github.com/plutus-dev/PlutusAPI/wiki) for more information about the upcoming API.
